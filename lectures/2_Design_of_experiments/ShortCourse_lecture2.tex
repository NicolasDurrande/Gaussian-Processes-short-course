We have seen yesterday how to build a model from a given set of input/output tuples:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/R/model_0}
\end{center}
Today's question is: How to choose the input points to get the best model?
\end{frame}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Classical designs
	\item Space filling designs
	\item Optimal design for a given model
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
This lecture is based on a course of Victor Picheny (INRA) at Mines St-\'Etienne.\\
\vspace{5mm}
We have focus in the past lecture on 1-dimensional examples, we have to bear in mind that the input space is often of high dimension ($d$ from 5 to 100).
\end{frame}

Intuition is often misleading in high-dimension:
\begin{exampleblock}{Examples 1/2}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Points in the unit cube can be far away\\ \qquad $\rightarrow$ the diagonal of the unit cube is of length $\sqrt{d}$
	\item All the volume is near the domain boundaries \\ \qquad $\rightarrow$ let us consider a hypercube of size 0.9 included in the the unit cube:\vspace{5mm}

\section[Classical DoE]{Classical designs}
\subsection{}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{One at a time design}
An intuitive way to check the influence of various variable is to make them change one at the time.
\begin{itemize}
	\item All variables are fixed at a reference value (0 for example)
	\item One variable is changed at a time to see if there is an influence
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{example}
\begin{columns}[c]
\column{5cm}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4cm]{figures/latexdraw/1atatime}
\end{center}
\column{5cm}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|ccc|}
  \hline
  point & $x_1$ & $x_2$ & $x_3$ \\ \hline
  $X_1$ & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  $X_2$ & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
  $X_3$ & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
  $X_4$ & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{columns}
\end{example}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
\textbf{pros and cons of this kind of design}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[+] require only $d+1$ observations
  \item[+] are easy to interpret
  \item[] \vspace{-4mm}
  \item[$-$] they can only see linear effects:
  \begin{center}
  $m(x)=\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3$
  \end{center}
  \item[$-$] they do not cover the space
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{exampleblock}{Exercise}
How can this kind of design be adapted to estimate quadratic effect?
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
\begin{exampleblock}{Solution}
Quadratic effects can be estimated with either
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.5cm]{figures/latexdraw/1atatime1} \hspace{10mm}
\includegraphics[width=4.5cm]{figures/latexdraw/1atatime2}
\end{center}
we sometime talk about ``star shaped'' design.
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Factorial designs}
The principle of factorial design is to consider all combinations for $x_i \in \{0,1\}$:
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{columns}[c]
\column{4cm}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4cm]{figures/latexdraw/factorial}
\end{center}
\column{6cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{pros}] They allow to get all interaction terms:
\end{itemize}
	$$\beta_0 + \sum_k \beta_k x_k + \sum_{j,k} \beta_{j,k} x_j x_k  + \beta_{1,2,3} x_1 x_2 x_3$$
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{cons}] The number of evaluation is unrealistic when $d$ is large
\end{itemize}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Factorial designs}
It is also possible to build factorial designs with $k$ levels:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{figures/latexdraw/factorial3levels}
\end{center}
This allows to compute quadratic effects but the number of evaluations $k^d$ is even less realistic...
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
\textbf{Conclusion on classical designs:}\\
\structure{\textbf{pros:}}\\
\quad Easy to use\\
\quad adapted to continuous or discrete variables\\
\quad Can be combined (star + factorial for example)\\
\quad Well suited (often optimal) for linear regression\\
\vspace{5mm}
\structure{\textbf{cons:}}\\
\quad Number of evaluation is not flexible\\
\quad Number of evaluation too large in high dimension\\
\quad Points are on top of each other when projected
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{projection issues}
Why don't we want points to be superimposed when projected?\\
If one of the variables has no influence, most observations become redundant...
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=4.5cm]{figures/latexdraw/factorialprojection}

From 27 observations, we end up with only 9...
\end{frame}

\section{Space filling DoE}
\subsection{}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
We will now focus on designs of experiments that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item are not model oriented
	\item give information about every domain of the input space
	\item have good projection on subspaces
	\item have a flexible number of points
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
How can we evaluate if a set of points fills the space?\\ \vspace{5mm}
\textbf{Option 1.} Compute distances between points\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item[maximin] the minimum distance between two points of the design should be large:
	$$\text{Optimisation problem is: \quad} \max_{X_1,\dots,X_n} [ \min_{i \neq j} dist(X_i,X_j) ]$$
	\item[minimax] the maximum distance between any point of the space and closest design point should be small:
	$$\text{Optimisation problem is: \quad} \min_{X_1,\dots,X_n} (\max_{x \in D} [ \min_i dist(x,X_i) ])$$
\end{itemize}
The second criterion is much more difficult to optimise
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
These criteria can be illustrated on a simple 2-dimensional example
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=6.5cm]{figures/python/spf_minimaxmaximin}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
How can we evaluate if a set of points fills the space?\\ \vspace{2mm}
\textbf{Option 2.} Compare the distribution with an uniform distribution\\ \vspace{2mm}
\structure{Discrepency} is a measure of non uniformity. It compares the number of points in a hyper-rectangle with the expected number of samples from a uniform distribution
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{columns}[c]
\column{4cm}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=4cm]{figures/latexdraw/discrepency}
\end{center}
\column{6cm}
\vspace{1mm}
The probability for a uniform variable to be in $R$ is 0.22 and we observe an empirical probability of $2/11$. The discrepancy (w.r.t. $R$) is then:
$$D_R = |0.22-2/11| = 0.038$$
\end{columns}
\vspace{2mm}
Discrepency is defined as the sup of the distance between the empirical and analytical cdf.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
Discrepency is often computed by:
\begin{itemize}
 	\item fixing one of the hyper-rectangle summit at the origin
 	\item centering the hyper-rectangle
 \end{itemize}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=4.5cm]{figures/latexdraw/discrepency3}
\end{center}
The maximum is located where the rectangle is tangent to points\\
$\rightarrow$ The optimisation is over a finite space
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
We will now give an overview on three types of space filling designs:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Latin hypercubes
	\item low discrepancy sequences
	\item centroidal Voronoi tesselations
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Latin hypercubes}
\textbf{Latin hypercubes} are designs where the domain is sliced in $n^d$ blocks and where there is only one point per ``line'' and ``column'':
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/latexdraw/lhs1}
\end{center}
These designs have good projection properties
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
A well known example of LHS in 2D is... Sudoku
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/sudoku}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
If we focus on one digit (say $4$), we obtain a LHD:
\vspace{2mm}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/latexdraw/sudoku}
\end{center}
Sudoku have more properties that LHD: the generalisation is called \textbf{orthogonal array}.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
Latin hypercubes do not necessarily cover the space very well...
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=4.5cm]{figures/latexdraw/lhs2}
\end{center}
They have to be combined with a criterion such as maximin.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
\begin{exampleblock}{Exercise}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Generate a 5 points LHD in dimension 3.
	\item How would you program a function \texttt{LHD(n,d)}?
	\item How would you optimize a LHD to ensure it fills the space properly?
\end{itemize}
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
LHD optimization with simulated annealing:\\
\vspace{4mm}
\textbf{Morris and Mitchell Algorithm}\\
\vspace{2mm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1] Generate LHD
	\item[2] find ``bad'' points according to maximin
	\item[3] choose randomly a column of this critical point and exchange it with an randomly selected other point
	\item[4] \qquad if the criteria is improved, the modification is accepted
	\item[5] \qquad otherwise, it is accepted with a probability of $$\exp \left(\frac{maximin_{new}-maximin_{old}}{T}\right)$$
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Low discrepancy sequences}
\textbf{Low discrepancy sequences} are deterministic sequences that converge toward the uniform distribution.
\begin{itemize}
	\item They cover the space quickly and evenly
	\item They are easy to build
	\item It is easy to add new points
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
Many low discrepancy sequences can be found in the literature: Halton, Hammerley, Sobol', Faure, van der Corput, ...
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
\begin{example}[Halton sequence]
	Let $a$ and $b$ be two integers with no common dividers (say 2 and 3). The $x_1$ and $x_2$ coordinates of the Halton sequence are:
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
			x_1 &= 1/2,\ 1/4,\ 3/4,\ 1/8,\ 5/8,\ 3/8,\ 7/8,\ 1/16,\ 9/16, \dots\\
			x_2 &= 1/3,\ 2/3,\ 1/9,\ 4/9,\ 7/9,\ 2/9,\ 5/9,\ 8/9,\ 1/27, \dots
		\end{split}
	\end{equation*}

\end{example}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
Issues with low discrepancy sequences:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[$-$] there can be alignments when projected
	\item[$-$] there can be holes in subspaces
	\item[$-$] points may be aligned (Example: 16 first points in basis (17,18))
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Centroidal Voronoi Tesselations}
Given a set of generative points $X$, the \textbf{Voronoi Tesselations} (or Voronoi cells) associated to the point $X_i$ is the region of the space such that $X_i$ is the closest point from the set:

\section[Optimal DoE for LR]{Optimal design for regression}
\subsection{}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Design for regression models}
We have seen during yesterday's lecture the expression of the mean and variance of a linear regression model:
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		m(x) & = B(x) (B(X)^t B(X))^{-1} B(X)^t F\\
		v(x) & = \sigma^2 B(x) (B(X)^t B(X))^{-1} B(x)^t
	\end{split}
\end{equation*}
where $B$ is a set of basis functions, $X$ is the DoE, $F$ is the vector of observations and $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the observation noise.\\
\vspace{5mm}
What would be the designs such that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\hat{\beta}$ is a good estimate of $\beta$?
	\item the prediction variance is minimal?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
\begin{exampleblock}{Exercise}
	We consider a linear regression model over $(0,1)$ with one basis function $b(x)=x$ and one observation $X_1$.
	\begin{enumerate}
	 	\item Give the expression of $m$ and $v$.
	 	\item What is the value of $X_1$ minimizing the maximum of $v$?
	 	\item What is the value of $X_1$ minimizing the variance of $\hat{\beta}$?
	 \end{enumerate}
	What happen if we have two basis functions $b_0(x)=1$, $b_1(x)=x$ and two observations?
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
From the previous example, we can see that
\begin{itemize}
	\item Minimising beta variance $\Leftrightarrow$ Minimising prediction variance
	\item $X$ only has an influence on the term $(B(X)^t B(X))^{-1}$, which is the covariance matrix of $\hat{\beta}$ (up to a $\sigma^2$ factor)
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{columns}[c]
\column{3cm}
We thus want to minimise this uncertainty.

\textbf{Various criteria for the variability of the estimate:}
\begin{block}{D-optimality}
	The volume of the confidence ellipsoid is minimized
	$$ \min_X \mathrm{det} (B(X)^t B(X))^{-1} = \max \mathrm{det} B(X)^t B(X)$$
\end{block}
\begin{block}{A-optimality}
	The sum of the coefficients variance is minimized
	$$ \min_X \mathrm{tr} (B(X)^t B(X))^{-1} $$
\end{block}
\begin{block}{E-optimality}
	The maximum eigenvalue of $(B(X)^t B(X))^{-1}$ is minimized
	$$ \min_X \max_i \lambda_i \text{\qquad (where $\lambda_i$ is eigenvalue of $B(X)^t B(X))$}$$
\end{block}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
\textbf{Various criteria for the prediction variance:}
\begin{block}{G-optimality}
	maximum of the prediction variance is minimized
	$$ \min_X \max_x \sigma^2 B(x) (B(X)^t B(X))^{-1} B(x)^t$$
\end{block}
\begin{block}{IMSE-optimality (or I-optimality)}
	the integrated variance is minimized
	$$ \min_X \int \sigma^2 B(x) (B(X)^t B(X))^{-1} B(x)^t \dx x$$
\end{block}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
In practice, the optimization of these criterion is difficult:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Large number of variables ($n \times d$)
	\item multimodal function (lots of symmetries)
\end{itemize}
\vspace{10mm}
Some algorithms (such as Fedorov) are based on one at a time points replacement:
\begin{itemize}
 	\item[1.] Find the worst point in the Design
 	\item[2.] Find a critic region (large variance)
 	\item[3.] Replace the ``bad'' point by a point in the critic region
 \end{itemize}

 \end{itemize}
\end{block}
\vspace{5mm}
Knowing a lower bound allows to define the efficiency of a DoE:
$$G_{eff} = 100 \times \sqrt{ \frac{\max_x \sigma^2 B(x) (B(X)^t B(X))^{-1} B(x)^t}{p}}$$

\subsection{}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}{}
% As previously, we can discuss two kinds of optimality:
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item In the parameter estimations
% 	\item In the prediction variance
% \end{itemize}
% \vspace{5mm}
% We will distinguish two cases: when the covariance parameters are known or not.

\begin{frame}{}
A GP $Z$ with covariance $k$ can be decomposed as a sum of two independent GPs:
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
	Z(x) & = \underbrace{k(x,X)k(X,X)^{-1}Z(X)}_{Z_X(x)} + \underbrace{Z(x) - k(x,X)k(X,X)^{-1}Z(X)}_{Z_{X^\perp}(x)}\\
	k(x,y) &= \underbrace{k(x,X)k(X,X)^{-1}k(X,y)}_{k_X(x,y)} + \underbrace{k(x,y) - k_X(x,y)}_{k_{X^\perp}(x,y)}
	\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\ \\
In order to capture most of the variability of $Z$, we can:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Maximize the variability of $Z_C(X)$ and apply previous D/A/E-optimality criterion to $k(X,X)$ instead of $B(X)^tB(X)$.
	\item Minimize the prediction error: I/G-optimality to $k_{X^\perp}(x,x)$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{known covariance parameters}
If we maximise the determinant of $k(X,X)$ for a 9 points DoE on $(0,1)^2$, we find the following design:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/python/opt_XD}
\end{center}
however, this design is not I-optimal nor G-optimal...

\begin{frame}{known covariance parameters}
We can compute numerically the optimal shrinking factor:
\vspace{2mm}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=3.9cm]{figures/python/opt_IG} \qquad
\includegraphics[height=4cm]{figures/python/opt_XIG}
\end{center}
\vspace{2mm}
$\Rightarrow$ They all give a different optimal DoE.

% \begin{frame}{unknown covariance parameters}
% What about \textbf{unknown} covariance parameter?\\
% The model parameters (ie the kernel's) can be estimated using maximum likelihood. \\
% \vspace{5mm}
% Can we find a design that gives a good parameter estimation of the variance and lengthscale?
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item There is no strong theoretical results
% 	\item Good estimation of the variance requires the points to be far away
% 	\item Good estimation of the lengthscale requires the points to be close by
% \end{itemize}
% If the covariance structure itself is unknown, it is interesting to have in the design a large variety of inter-distances.

Small recap on optimal design for GPR
\begin{itemize}
	\item All criteria are difficult to compute
	\item The optimization problem is tricky
	\item We don't have strong theoretical results as in regression
\end{itemize}
\vspace{3mm}
Good practice:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use of space filling designs
	\item Optimization inside a class of DoE
\end{itemize}
\vspace{3mm}
\structure{Remark:} IMSE is more correlated to minimax than maximin

\section[Adaptive DoE]{Adaptive Designs}
\subsection{}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
The principle of \textbf{adaptive design} is to add the points in the design one after each other.\\
\qquad $\rightarrow$ the $n \times d$-dimensional optimisation is transformed into $n$  optimisations in $d$ dimensions.
\begin{block}{This is still expensive}
One new model has to be built for each candidate point. Furthermore, for each candidate model:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I-optimality requires to compute a high dimensional integral
		\item G-optimality requires to optimize the variance
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
An approximation that is not computationaly expensive is to add the new point where the model variance is maximum:
\begin{block}{Algorithm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[1] Build an initial DoE X with k points
		\item[2] While $i < n-k$
		\item[3] \qquad find $x^* = \mathrm{argmax}(c(x,x))$
		\item[4] \qquad add  $x^*$ to the design and recompute $c(x,x)$
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\textbf{Best model estimation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item D-optimality
	\item A-optimality
	\item E-optimality

\textbf{lowest prediction error}
\begin{itemize}
	\item G-optimality
	\item I-optimality
\end{itemize}

For GPR, it's much more tricky!

% 	\item large number of variables: $n \times d$
% 	\item computationally expensive criteria

% \textbf{Alternatives are:}
% 	\begin{itemize}
