%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
There is a wide variety of situations where getting data about a system performance can be extremely expensive.
\begin{itemize}
	\item real world experiments
	\item destructive tests

\begin{frame}{}
In all these cases, the variable of interest can be seen as a function of the input parameters
$$ y = f(x). $$
where $f$ is a \textbf{costly to evaluate function}. \\
\vspace{5mm}
In the following, we will assume that 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $x \in \mathds{R}^d$: There are many input parameters
	\item $y \in \mathds{R}$: The output is a scalar.

\section[Statistical models]{Statistical models}
\subsection{}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
The principle of statistical modelling is to use the data to build a mathematical approximation of the function. 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=4.5cm]{figures/ink_m}
\end{center}
The model can then be used to answer all previous questions
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
Of course, there is a difference between $f$ and $m$...
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/ink_mf}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
Why \textbf{statistical models}? \\We want to be able to quantify the model error:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/ink_mconfint}
\end{center}
The confidence intervals can be used to obtain a \textbf{measure of uncertainty on the value of interest}.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
In the sequel, we will use the following notations : 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The set of observation points will be represented by a $n \times d$ matrix $X=(X_1, ..., X_n)^t$
	\item The vector of observations will be denoted by $F$ : $F_i=f(X_i)$ (or $F=f(X)$).
\end{itemize}
We will now discuss two types of statistical models:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Linear regression
	\item Gaussian process regression
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Linear Regression}
\subsection{}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
\textbf{Linear regression} is probably the most commonly used statistical model.\\ \vspace{3mm}
Given a set of basis functions $B=(b_0, \dots, b_p)$, we assume that the observations come from the probabilistic model
$$ F = B(X) \beta  + \varepsilon \qquad \qquad \left( \text{i.e. } F_i = \sum_{k=1}^p \beta_k b_k(X_i) + \varepsilon_i \right) $$
where the vector $\beta$ is unknown and the $\varepsilon_i$ are independent and identically distributed.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
If we consider a model of the form 
$$m(x) = B(x) \hat{\beta}$$
the prediction error (Residual Sum of Square) is given by 
$$RSS = (B(X) \hat{\beta}  - F)^t(\hat{\beta} B(X) - F)  \qquad \qquad \left( \text{i.e. } \sum_{k=1}^n ( B(X_i) \hat{\beta} - F_i)^2\right)$$ 

Finding the optimal value of $\hat{\beta}$ means minimizing a quadratic form. This can be done analytically and we obtain $\hat{\beta} = (B(X)^t B(X))^{-1} B(X)^t F$.\\
\vspace{3mm}
The associated linear regression model is thus
$$m(x) = B(x) (B(X)^t B(X))^{-1} B(X)^t F.$$
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
\begin{example}
	If we consider the following observations: 
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/R/linreg_0}
\end{center}
\end{example}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
\begin{example}
	and a set of 3 basis functions:
	 $$b_0(x)=1,\ b_1(x)=x,\ b_2(x)=x^2$$
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/R/linreg_1}
\end{center}
\end{example}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
\begin{example}
We obtain $\hat{\beta} = (1.06,-0.61,1.04)$ and the model is:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/R/linreg_2}
\end{center}
\end{example}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
\begin{example}
There is of course an error between the true generative function and the model
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/R/linreg_3}
\end{center}
Can this error be quantified?
\end{example}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
The initial assumption is $ F = B(X) \beta  + \varepsilon$ and we have computed an estimator of $\beta$:
$$\hat{\beta} = (B(X)^t B(X))^{-1} B(X)^t F.$$
$\hat{\beta}$ can thus be seen as a sample from the random variable:
$$\hat{\beta} = (B(X)^t B(X))^{-1} B(X)^t (B(X) \beta  + \varepsilon).$$ \\
\vspace{5mm}
What about the distribution of $\hat{\beta}$? \pause
\begin{itemize}
	\item Its expectation is $\beta$ \alert{$\Rightarrow$} The estimator is unbiased
	\item Its covariance matrix is $$(B(X)^t B(X))^{-1} B(X)^t \Cov[\varepsilon,\varepsilon^t] B(X) (B(X)^t B(X))^{-1}$$
	\item If $\varepsilon$ is multivariate normal, then $\hat{\beta}$ is also multivariate normal.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
Sampling in the distribution of $\hat{\beta}$ gives us a large variety of models which represent the uncertainty about our estimation:
\begin{exampleblock}{Back to the example}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/R/linreg_4}
\end{center}
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
\begin{exampleblock}{Back to the example}
The previous picture can be summarized by showing the mean of $m$ and $95\%$ confidence intervals
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/R/linreg_5}
\end{center}
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
Knowing the uncertainty on the model allows to compute an uncertainty on the quantity of interest.
\begin{exampleblock}{Back to the example}
For example, if we are interested in the value $x^\star$ minimizing $f(x)$:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/R/linreg_6}
\end{center}
\end{exampleblock}
\alert{The expectation of $x^\star$ \textbf{is not} the input minimizing $m(x).$}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
\textbf{\structure{Model validation}} is always of upper importance.\\ 
\vspace{3mm}
The goodness of fit can be measured by the \textbf{coefficient of determination}:
$$R^2 =  1 - \frac{\Var[prediction\ errors]}{\Var[data]} = 1 - \frac{\sum_i (F_i-m(X_i))^2}{\sum_i (F_i-mean(F))^2}$$
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=4cm]{figures/ink_R2}
\end{center}
\alert{Be careful!} A good $R^2$ (ie close to one) does not necessarily mean that the model is good.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
The influence of one basis function can be tested using \textbf{p-values}:\\
\qquad $H_0$: The basis function $b_i$ has no influence\\
\qquad p-values: probability of observing a larger estimate
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=4.5cm]{figures/ink_pvalue}
\end{center}
The smaller the p-value is, the less $\hat{\beta}$ is likely to be due to chance.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
We could dedicate the entire course to linear regression models...

\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Reminders on Multivariate normal distribution
    \item Gaussian processes
    \item Gaussian process regression
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\subsection{Multivariate normal distribution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{1. Multivariate normal distribution}
The usual one dimensional normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$ has the following pdf:
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp \left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right) \text{ for } x \in \mathds{R}
\end{equation*} 
It can be generalised to vectors:
\begin{definition}
	We say that a vector $Y=(Y_1, \dots, Y_n)$ follows a multivariate normal distribution if any linear combination of $Y$ follows a normal distribution:
	\begin{equation*}
		\forall \alpha \in \mathds{R}^n,\ \alpha^t Y \sim \mathcal{N}(m,s^2)
	\end{equation*}
\end{definition}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
The distribution of a Gaussian vector is characterised by
\begin{itemize}
 	\item a mean vector $\mu = (\mu_1, \dots, \mu_d)$
 	\item a $d \times d$ covariance matrix $\Sigma$ : $\Sigma_{i,j}=\Cov(Y_i, Y_j)$
\end{itemize} 
\vspace{5mm}
\structure{Property:}\\
A covariance matrix is 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{symmetric} $K_{i,j}=K_{j,i}$
	\item \textbf{positive semi-definite} $\forall \alpha \in \mathds{R}^d, \alpha^t K \alpha \geq 0$.
\end{itemize} 
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
The density of a multivariate Gaussian is:
\begin{equation*}
f_Y(x) = \frac{1}{\displaystyle (2 \pi)^{d/2} |\Sigma|^{1/2}} \exp \left(-\frac12 (x-\mu)^t \Sigma^{-1} (x-\mu)  \right).

Let $(Y,Z)$ be a Gaussian vector ($Y$ and $Z$ may both be vectors) with mean $(\mu_Y,\mu_Z)^t$ and covariance matrix

\begin{pmatrix}
	\Cov(Y,Y) & \Cov(Y,Z)\\
	\Cov(Z,Y) & \Cov(Z,Z)\\
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
The conditional distribution of $Y$ knowing $Z$ is still multivariate normal $Y|Z \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{cond},\Sigma_{cond})$ with
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
	\mu_{cond} &= \E [Y|Z] = \mu_Y + \Cov(Y,Z) \Cov(Z,Z)^{-1} (Z-\mu_Z)\\ 
	\Sigma_{cond} &= \Cov [Y,Y|Z] = \Cov(Y,Y) - \Cov(Y,Z) \Cov(Z,Z)^{-1} \Cov(Z,Y)

\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\subsection{Gaussian processes}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{2. Gaussian processes}
The multivariate Gaussian distribution can be generalised to random processes: 
\begin{definition}
A random process $Z$ over $D \subset \mathds{R}^d$ is said to be Gaussian if 
\begin{equation*}
\forall n \in \mathds{N}, \forall x_i \in D, (Z(x_1),\dots,Z(x_n)) \text{  is a Gaussian vector}.
\end{equation*} 
\end{definition}
The distribution of a GP is fully characterised by:
\begin{itemize}
	\item its mean function $m$ defined over $D$ 
	\item its covariance function (or kernel) $k$ defined over $D \times D$: $k(x,y) = \Cov(Z(x),Z(y))$
\end{itemize}
We will use the notation $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(m(.),k(.,.))$.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
A kernel satisfies the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item It is symmetric: $k(x,y) = k(y,x)$
	\item It is positive semi-definite (psd):
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation*}
	\forall n \in \mathds{N}, \forall x_i \in D, \forall \alpha \in \mathds{R}^n,\  \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j k(x_i,x_j) \geq 0
\end{equation*}
\vspace{5mm} \\
Furthermore any symmetric psd function can be seen as the covariance of a Gaussian process. This equivalence is known as the Loeve theorem.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
Proving that a function is psd is often intractable. However there are a lot of functions that have already been proven to be psd:\\

\end{tabular}\\
\vspace{2mm}
\normalsize
When $k$ is a function of $x-y$, the kernel is called \textbf{stationary}.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
Can we look at the sample paths associated to these kernels?\\
\vspace{5mm}
In order to simulate sample paths from a GP $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(m(.),k(.,.))$, we will consider samples of the GP discretised on a fine grid.

In higher dimension one can introduce one lengthscale parameter per dimension. The usual Euclidean distance between two points $|| x-y || = ( \sum (x_i-y_i)^2)^{1/2}$ is thus replaced by
\begin{equation*}
	\Ni{x-y}{\theta} = \left( \sum_{i=1}^d \frac{(x_i-y_i)^2}{\theta_i^2} \right)^{1/2}.
\end{equation*}
If the parameters $\theta_i$ are equal for all the dimensions, the covariance (or the process) is called \textbf{isotropic}.

%\subsection{Gaussian process regression}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{3. Gaussian process regression}
We assume we have observed a function $f$ for a set of points $X = (X_1,\dots,X_n)$:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/R/Fig1-data}
\end{center}
The vector of observations is $F=f(X)$ (ie $F_i = f(X_i)$ ).
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
Since $f$ in unknown, we make the general assumption that
it is the sample path of a Gaussian process $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,k)$:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/R/Fig1b-sim}
\end{center}
What would be the next step? 
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
We can look at the conditional distribution of $Z$ knowing that it interpolates the data points: 
\begin{exampleblock}{Exercice}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.] What is the conditional distribution of $Z(x)|Z(X)=F$?
	\item[2.] Compute the conditional mean $m$ and covariance $c(.,.)$.
	\item[3.] Compute $m(X_1)$ and $c(X_1,X_1)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
\begin{exampleblock}{Solution}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[1.] The conditional distribution is Gaussian.
		\item[2.] It has mean and variance
			\begin{equation*}
			\begin{split}
				m(x) &= \E[Z(x)|Z(X) \shorteq F] \\
				&= k(x,X) k(X,X)^{-1} F \\ \vspace{3mm}
				c(x,y) &= \Cov[Z(x),Z(y)|Z(X) \shorteq F] \\
				&= k(x,y) - k(x,X) k(X,X)^{-1} k(X,y)
			\end{split}
			\end{equation*}
		\item[3.] We have $m(X_1)=F_1$ and $c(X_1,X_1)=0$
		\end{itemize}
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A few remarkable properties of GPR models 
\begin{itemize}
	\item They interpolate the data-points
	\item The prediction variance does not depend on the observations
	\item The mean predictor does not depend on the variance
	\item They (usually) come back to zero when we are far away from the observations.
\end{itemize}
Can you prove them?
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
Changing the the kernel \alert{has a huge impact on the model}:\\ 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=4cm]{figures/R/Fig2-GP-rbf} 
\includegraphics[height=4cm]{figures/R/Fig2-GP-exp}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
This is because changing the kernel means changing the prior on $f$\\ 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=4cm]{figures/R/Fig2-sim-rbf} 
\includegraphics[height=4cm]{figures/R/Fig2-sim-exp}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
The best predictor can be seen either as a linear combination of
\begin{itemize}
	\item the observations: $m(x)=\alpha^t F$
	\item the kernel evaluated at $X$: $m(x)=k(x,X) \beta$
\end{itemize} 
The later is interesting to understand the model shape and behaviour. \\
\vspace{5mm}
For example, we have for a squared exponential kernel
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=4cm]{figures/R/ch34_basisfuncGauss}

and for a Brownian kernel:

\includegraphics[height=4cm]{figures/R/ch34_basisfuncBrown}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
We are not always interested in models that interpolate the data. For example, if there is some observation noise: $F = f(X) + \varepsilon$.
% \begin{equation*}
% 	F = f(X) + \varepsilon
% \end{equation*}
% What would change in the model expression?
% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\vspace{5mm}
Let $N$ be a process $\mathcal{N}(0,n)$ that represent the observation noise. The expressions of GPR with noise are 
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
	m(x) &= \E[Z(x)|Z(X) + N(X) \shorteq F] \\
	&= k(x,X) (k(X,X)+n(X,X))^{-1} F \\ 
	& \\
	c(x,y) &= \Cov[Z(x),Z(y)|Z(X)+ N(X) \shorteq F] \\
	&= k(x,y) - k(x,X) (k(X,X)+n(X,X))^{-1} k(X,y)
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\end{frame}

Examples of models with observation noise for $n(x,y)=\tau^2 \delta_{x,y}$:

The values of $\tau^2$ are respectively 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1.

\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
\structure{Three things to remember:}\\ \vspace{3mm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Statistical models are useful when little data is available. they allow to
	\begin{itemize}
		\item interpolate or approximate functions
		\item Compute quantities of interests (such as mean value, optimum, ...)
		\item Get an error measure
	\end{itemize}
	\item GPR is similar to linear regression but the assumption is much weaker (not a finite dimensional space)
	\item The GPR equations are
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
			m(x) & = k(x,X)k(X,X)^{-1}F\\
			c(x,y) &= k(x,y) - k(x,X)k(X,X)^{-1}k(X,y)
		\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
We still have many things to discuss about such models:
\begin{itemize}
	\item How to choose the observation points?
	\item How to validate the model?
	\item How to estimate the model (ie kernel) parameters?
\end{itemize}
This will be discussed during the next courses.\\
